Here is most of the data for the western border fences, also done in the early part of the 2020/21 rainy season.  The excel files record data collected from the start of the E-W section close to Mohembo up to the N-W corner and then southwards for about 60km if I recall, somewhere along the border between the intersections with the Samuchima and Ikoga fences. The level of data collection for the border fence south thereof (which I am still to send) was unfortunately done later in the season, during and just after heavy rains (which constrained spoor detections) so it is not as directly comparable.  Bear that in mind when looking at the maps too.
